## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/group-chat-nextjs-firebase.git
   cd group-chat-nextjs-firebase
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Install Firebase tools globally (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   yarn global add firebase-tools
   ```

## Configuration

Before running the project, you'll need to set up Firebase and add the necessary configurations.

### Create a Firebase Project:
1. Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project
2. Enable Firebase Phone Authentication
3. Set up Firestore Database and create a collection for storing messages

### Add Firebase Configuration:
1. In the Firebase Console, go to your project settings and copy the Firebase config object
2. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and add the following:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
   ```

### Firebase Emulator Setup (Optional)
For local testing, use the Firebase emulator:
```bash
firebase emulators:start
```

## Firebase Setup

### Firebase Firestore
- Create a collection called `groupChat` where messages will be stored
- Optionally, create a sub-collection for each user's own copy of the message

### Firebase Authentication
- Enable Phone Authentication in the Firebase console
- Users will authenticate using their phone number

## Cloud Functions

The Firebase Cloud Functions are located in the `functions` folder of the project.

### Function to Handle New Message Notification
This Cloud Function triggers when a new message is added to Firestore and logs a message like "Notification sent to [Name] with id [UID]".

To deploy Cloud Functions:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## Security Rules

Implement these Firestore security rules to ensure secure data handling:

```javascript
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /groupChat/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.sender;
    }

    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## Deployment

### Deploy the Application
Deploy your application to Vercel by connecting your GitHub repository to Vercel and following their instructions.

### Deploy Firebase Functions
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Deploy Firestore Security Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore
```

## Usage

### Run Locally
Start the development server:
```bash
yarn dev
```

### Sign in with Phone Number
- Visit the app and sign in using your phone number
- Once authenticated, you can send and receive messages in the group chat

### Real-time Messaging
- Messages are displayed in real-time for all authenticated users
- New messages are automatically synchronized across all clients
